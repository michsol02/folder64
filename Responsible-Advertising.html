Integrating best practices on each relevant issue informs the overall business model. The business is an exemplar of best practices. It is vocal and campaigning on the issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>GOOD&nbsp;</strong>- Responsible advertising practices and sustainability are important to the business. A strategy is adopted that tackles a number of CAN’s focus areas albeit best practices cannot yet be demonstrated on each that applies. The business pursues best advertising practices in order to gain a competitive edge in relation to its peers.</li><li><strong>OKAY</strong> - The business might value responsible advertising practices and sustainability efforts but pursues solutions on a need basis without a formal strategy in place. Data collection without consent from consumers, Misinformation, hate speech, and other net-negative outcomes remain apparent in the company’s advertising department. Despite expressing a desire to alter consumer-company interactions to reflect a more ethical form of advertising, the business fails to demonstrate any concrete steps towards that particular goal. The business needs work on communicating with stakeholders and planning ahead.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>POOR&nbsp;</strong>- The business shows no initiative in altering practices to reflect a more socially responsible form of advertising. Unable to comprehend the long-term benefits in adopting an ethical approach, the business continues to depend on net-negative outcomes as a reliable model for growth. They adhere to a single-minded approach to ads that only focuses on increasing viewership using any means necessary. Stakeholders are led to believe that this approach is the most beneficial for them and the company as a whole. Evidence that consumers prefer to do business with more ethically conscious companies is kept hidden. The overall performance of the business is either inadequate or works against efforts to behave honestly and/or promote sustainability.</li>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><p>The following summarises key focus areas of CAN's works:</p><div><strong>&nbsp;Anti-Ad Fraud</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> -&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“The digital advertising ecosystem should be accountable for minimising ad-fraud across trading relationships”. Digital ad fraud generally refers to a situation in which an advertisement fails to reach its intended audience or location due to interference from bots, fake websites and other cyber criminal activities. This can contribute to the spread of misinformation, online hate speech, less effective advertising and have negative images on a brand’s reputation.</span><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Diversity </strong>-&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Ad agencies should ensure that content is as diverse as the society it serves, from research to strategy to media placement”. All businesses will be advertising to diverse audiences so it is necessary for businesses to consider what content is included in an advertisement, where they advertise, and how those advertisements are presented to ensure that no one is left out or offended. It is equally as important to have a diverse advertising department within a business to ensure that a variety of perspectives and backgrounds are incorporated into advertising practices.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Informed Consent </strong>-&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“People should be seen as active participants in, and controllers of, their own online experience”. Consumers should be aware of everything they may be consenting to when sharing their data with a business. It is the responsibility of a business to provide any necessary information about data collection processes in order to properly educate their consumers.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Hate Speech</strong> -&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Advertisers should take action to make hate unprofitable by eradicating it from their media spend and supporting media that plays a positive role”. In many cases, irresponsible advertising practices can inadvertently spread hate speech and extremist content which can </span>ostracise<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;customers. By avoiding advertising on media sites that spread extremist views and advocating for media platforms in which they advertise to better monitor hate speech, businesses can play a role in protecting their consumers.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Children’s Wellbeing</strong> -&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Advertising to children should be age appropriate, promote positive messaging and avoid glamorising negative behaviour”. Businesses must act responsibly when advertising towards children or on websites targeted at children, especially in regards to the types of data that the business may be collecting. By avoiding the collection of personal and behavioural data, businesses can contribute to protecting child privacy.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Misinformation </strong>-&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Advertisers must take the responsibility to ensure they don’t fund misinformation, click-bait and any intentionally misleading content”. Businesses should choose to advertise on credible and reputable sites while also working with advertising agencies that have proven to choose accuracy and fairness over the profit that may come from spreading inaccurate information.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Sustainability </strong>-&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“The content advertisers create, and the processes by which they are created, should be sustainable and responsibly considered, avoiding creating or funding climate crisis misinformation”. Many consumers today care deeply about the environmental impact of products and services they purchase which has resulted in an increase of companies making false claims in their advertisements to appear more climate-friendly. Businesses should work to ensure that all claims regarding a product’s sustainability and environmental impact are truthful while also considering the impact that advertisements themselves can have.</span></div><div>
