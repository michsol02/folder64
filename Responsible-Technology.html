                    <li><strong>EXCELLENT</strong> - Developing and using technology responsibly is fundamental to the business and of critical, strategic importance. The right support, funding and oversight goes into addressing the core concepts of responsible technology through the business and up and down its value chains. The business is constantly evolving to reflect a commitment to responsible technology by listening to feedback from experts and stakeholders. Internal conversations about the development of technological products and services are encouraged. Responsible technology practices are tied to the firm's overall mission.</li>
                    <li><strong>GOOD&nbsp;</strong>- The business demonstrates a clear commitment to responsible technology and has many good practices in place. Straightforward policies are set to ensure the responsible usage of technological products and services. Performance is regularly monitored but sometimes falls short. The firm makes a genuine effort to incorporate responsible technology policies and practices into the overall business model but is not at the forefront in efforts to tackle this issue.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>OKAY</strong> - The business recognizes the importance of the issue but only complies on an ad hoc  basis. Methods behind monitoring and measuring responsible technology practices need further development. Policies are adopted by the firm, but they are stated in general terms. The firm demonstrates an effort to improve future policies and practices and is able to acknowledge current shortcomings.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>POOR&nbsp;</strong>- The business does not respond to legitimate public concern or credible evidence of wrongdoing and/or negative impacts of its irresponsible tech practices. Policies might have been adopted but are not effectively enforced, monitored, or measured. The firm lacks an openness to dialogue about improving tech practices and fails to communicate regularly with stakeholders.&nbsp;</li>

Whilst technology has improved people’s lives in a myriad of ways, it is also responsible for negative impacts on individuals, communities, society and the environment. 
<div><br></div><div>It can be difficult to develop one definition of responsible technology as technology itself is complex, broad, vague and constantly changing. However, a simplified definition of responsible technology requires businesses to understand the complexities of their technology and consider its social impact and unintended consequences, as well as accepting a level of responsibility and accountability of those consequences. 
</div><div><br></div><div>To create or support responsible technology, companies ought to:
</div><div>&gt;&gt; Look beyond the individual user and take into account technology's potential impact and consequences on society as a whole
</div><div>&gt;&gt; Share how value is created in a transparent and understandable way
</div><div>&gt;&gt; Ensure best practice in technology that accounts for real, messy humans
</div><div><br></div><div>As the world becomes more reliant on technology, businesses must adapt their own practices regarding technology to protect their customers. Too many internet services are currently insecure and/or unreliable, as well as poorly architected, designed and maintained. Insecure systems and technologies don’t just affect their users — they affect others too. For example, hacked webcams could form a botnet, or children’s data could be leaked from Internet-connected toys. Firms need to ensure their technology is safe and secure with good practices surrounding its use.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>There are also concerns regarding the increase in artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithms which can be used in all kinds of activity to inform and to make decisions, including by the public sector, companies, educational institutions. With the increased amount of user data that is collected today, responsible companies should aim to ensure algorithms and AI are accountable and impartial whilst acknowledging the limitations of what they provide and making them easier for users to understand.</div><div><br></div><div> 
</div><div>Businesses should also aim to provide safe and responsible technology to all of their customers, not just those who are capable of spending large amounts of money to protect their information. Unfortunately, internet technologies often operate within old systems that disenfranchise already vulnerable and marginalised people.</div><div><br></div><div> 
</div><div>Overcoming these challenges requires firms to commit to develop and use responsible technology. This means innovation should consider people and the planet. Responsible technologies recognise and respect everyone's dignity and rights, give people confidence and trust in their use and should never knowingly create or deepen existing inequalities.</div><div>

The most popular example is Facebook, in which the platform generates the user’s newsfeed.</p><p>
</p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> - AI is ‘the designing and building of intelligent agents that receive precepts from the environment and take actions that affect that environment’. The most critical difference between AI and general purpose software is in the phrase “take action”. AI enables machines to respond on their own to signals from the world at large, signals that programmers do not directly control and therefore can’t anticipate.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Big Data</strong> - Extremely large data sets that may be analysed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially those relating to human behaviour and interactions.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Dominant Network Platforms</strong> - A small number of platforms are hugely dominant in their areas, like  Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. They wield incredible power in the markets they choose to be active in (including in buying potential competing companies, recruitment, and in R&amp;D). Due to the Internet’s network effects, big platforms may be inevitable — but their governance and accountability are far from ideal today.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Encryption </strong>- 'Encryption' is the process of taking an unencrypted message (plaintext), applying a mathematical function to it (encryption algorithm with a key) and producing an encrypted message (ciphertext).
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong> - The interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Machine Learning</strong> - A type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are often categorised as being supervised or unsupervised.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Personal Data</strong> - Data is the lowest level of abstraction from which information and knowledge are then derived. Personal data, then, is data specific to an individual or group. Data is collected and analysed to create information, while knowledge is derived from extensive amounts of experience dealing with information on a subject.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Privacy by Design</strong> - 'Privacy by Design' is an approach to systems engineering which takes privacy into account throughout the whole engineering process.

</p><p>After releasing documents that made up the Facebook Files, Frances Haugen claims that she never intended to bring ‘hate’ towards the company but rather to bring light to Facebook’s irresponsible practices.

</p><p>New Trust data from the Tech cut of the Edelman Trust Barometer reveals that trust in technology has reached an all-time low in 17 of the 22 countries it tracks. Some estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic has condensed 10 years of digital transformation into a single year. While technology has helped people and businesses manage through these historic times, the acceleration of AI and machine learning create social challenges for businesses to navigate.
