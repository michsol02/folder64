                <ul>
                    <li><strong>EXCELLENT</strong> - The business develops steps and procedures to prepare for any type of cyber attack. Promoting and enabling thorough cyber security is fundamental to the business. Protecting the personal information of customers and business information is a crucial factor in achieving the company’s mission. A holistic approach is taken, which includes policies and tools to identify, address and prevent mental ill health caused or worsened by work. In doing so, the business produces net-positive impacts in the fight against cyber attacks. Excellence is reflected in this field through an understanding of the evolving nature of cyber threats. The business actively seeks the best practices and campaigns on their strength in protecting their employees and customers against hackers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>GOOD&nbsp;</strong>- The business demonstrates a commitment to promoting cyber security with clear practices and policies in place. It is a topic discussed with employees in meetings and other professional settings. IT systems are constantly monitoring networks to catch a cyber threat before it spreads. Cyber security might not be fully merged with the company’s mission, but the business is moving in the right direction toward net-positive outcomes. Business leaders communicate the need for cyber security to employees and customers.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>OKAY</strong> - The business supports efforts regarding cyber security on an ad hoc basis. The topic is still mentioned during meetings and a commitment to long-term changes is made. But there is a lack of concrete steps established for ensuring cyber security, which opens the business to more threats in the future. The business might be developing strategies but no official plans have been enforced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>POOR&nbsp;</strong>- The business acknowledges performance is below expectations and does not actively find ways to protect against cyber threats. The workplace might also deepen or perpetuate poor cyber security. They fail to meet regulations and no team and/or plan is developed to respond to cyber issues. There is also a lack of proper software equipment in place.&nbsp;</li></ul>

The field covers all the processes and mechanisms by which computer-based equipment, information and services are protected from unintended or unauthorised access, change or destruction, and is of growing importance in line with the increasing reliance on computer systems worldwide.</p><p>
</p><div>
</div><div>The Internet has become a crucial part of daily life for individuals and businesses. As such, cyber security is crucial to all businesses, regardless of size or sector. While no organisation is ever 100% secure, cyber security is about taking steps to manage future risks. Without adequate cyber security measures embedded into culture and operations, businesses are taking huge risks. Recent events, such as the WannaCry ransomware attacks, the Equifax breach and the leaking of thousands of personal emails have received global media attention and exemplified the importance of protecting the information that is sensitive both to businesses and their customers.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>'Sensitive information' is data that must be protected from unauthorised access to safeguard the privacy or security of an individual or organisation. There are three types: 
</div><div><br></div><div>&gt;&gt; Personal information</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This is any information that can be used for identity theft, as it’s tied to a specific individual.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Examples include National Insurance Numbers, credit card numbers, tax information, and more</span></div><div><br></div><div>&gt;&gt; Business information</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This is any information that would have a negative impact on the business if released.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Examples include trade secrets or customer records.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div>&gt;&gt; Classified information</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Small businesses are unlikely to have to worry about classified information, as this is information that is classified as sensitive by the government, and access to it is therefore restricted.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div>A 'cyber attack' is the attempt by a hacker or hackers to destroy a computer network or system, or destroy, change, or steal the information contained in it. The information that cyber attacks target tends to be the sensitive information, but that is not always the case.
</div><div><br></div><div>A business’s preparedness for a cyber attack, and how it responds in the event of an attack, can have profound impacts up to and including complete organisational failure. The 2022 Information Security Breaches Survey reported that 72% of large firms had experienced a security breach of some sort. An FSB report published in June 2016 notes that 66% of small businesses have been victims of cybercrime, often more than once. Each of these crimes reportedly cost small businesses, on average, nearly £3,000. Given the impact of these breaches, cyber security is not exclusively an issue for large multinationals.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Businesses of all sizes increasingly hold enormous amounts of customers’ and employees’ private data, including ‘big data’ and ‘metadata’ on members of the public. Such data can be used to establish detailed and accurate profiles of individual behaviour and consumer habits, raising concerns over privacy and data ownership. Despite the significant financial and ethical dangers that accompany cybercrime, there is significant evidence that cyber security is still not treated as a high-priority strategic issue by many businesses.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Understanding and recognising the evolving landscape of cyber threats at the board level is essential to the sustainability and competitiveness of businesses. Acting on cyber security requires being prepared for and responding to breaches, and concerns intellectual property, customer information, resources, financial data, employee records, and much more. From coffee machines to driverless cars, everything that is linked to a network has the potential to be accessed by ‘hackers’: individuals who attempt to gain unauthorised access to a computer system by exploiting its weaknesses or design flaws.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>This increase in interconnectivity is becoming more prevalent with the ability to collect much more data from more individuals and more sensitive data. The growth of the ‘Internet of Things’ is also a major contributor to the vulnerability that hackers take advantage of. The ‘Internet of Things’ is the interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data. The security built into all products and services is becoming even more important, as well as that used by companies in their business practices.</div><div>

Malware is commonly taken to include computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware and adware.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Patching </strong>-&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">A 'patch' is a software update consisting of code inserted (or patched) into the code of an executable program. Typically, a patch is installed into an existing software program. Patches are often temporary fixes between full releases of a software package.</span></div><div>Patches may do any of the following:
</div><div>&gt;&gt; Fix a software bug
</div><div>&gt;&gt; Install new drivers
</div><div>&gt;&gt; Address new security vulnerabilities
</div><div>&gt;&gt; Address software stability issues
</div><div>&gt;&gt; Upgrade the software.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Phishing </strong>-&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">a method used by criminals to try to obtain financial or other confidential information (including usernames and passwords) from internet users, usually by sending an email that looks as though it has been sent by a legitimate organisation (often a bank). The email usually contains a link to a fake website that looks authentic.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Privacy by Design</strong> -&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">an approach to systems engineering which takes privacy into account throughout the whole engineering process.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Ransomware </strong>-<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Sensitive Information</strong> -<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;data that must be protected from unauthorised access to safeguard the privacy or security of an individual or organisation. There are three types: personal information, business information, and classified information.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Spear Phishing</strong> -&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">An email designed to obtain financial or other confidential information, however, differs from a simple phishing email in that it is more targeted at an individual or organisation. Some basic information has already been obtained and used to make this email appear more genuine and therefore trustworthy. The email will appear to come from either a specific person, sometimes from within the same company as the target, or from an organisation the person has a relationship with.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Spyware </strong>-&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">malware that passes information about a computer user’s activities to an external party.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Two-factor identification</strong> -&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The use of security steps additional to username and password. This step requires something that only the user would have, such as a piece of information or physical objects, such as a PIN or card reader.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Virus </strong>-&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The most common form of malware is the 'virus', which is loaded onto a computer and then runs without the user's knowledge or knowledge of its full effects.</span></div><div>
