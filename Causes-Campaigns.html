            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><p>As an employee, manager or business owner you likely have certain social, political or economic issues that you keep apprised of and care about. This is the same for a large portion of your customers. Organising your business in ways that support your values can not only benefit the world, but also benefit the welfare of your company.</p><p> 
</p><div>
</div><div>There are numerous ways to get involved at varying levels. Depending on your preferences, resources and priorities, you can choose to support multiple causes through methods that integrate your beliefs with your business plan.</div><div><br></div><div> 
</div><div>Additionally, there can be dangers to not remaining aware of current events and how your business may relate to ongoing ethical and political disputes. A company does not always need to involve itself in such causes, but it may be wise to take note of how your dealings make an impact regarding certain issues.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Historically speaking, different campaigns and movements have led the charge in creating large societal changes which affect people on every level of society. Choosing to support or oppose such causes and campaigns can have both positive and negative effects. Taking a side on a highly polarised issue may sometimes alienate customers. That is not to say that this is the incorrect move in every case, just that such a result could be wise to consider when making business decisions.</div><div><br></div><div> 
</div><div>A recent example of this would be the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine. On 4 February 2022, Russia invaded the Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that began in 2014. The invasion caused Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II, with more than 8.8 million Ukrainians fleeing the country and a third of the population displaced. This event had a global effect with many nations and companies decrying Russia’s actions and cutting ties with the nation as a result. Additionally, many businesses have donated a portion of their profits to assist in the crisis.</div><div><br></div><div> 
</div><div>This event is important for organisations to be aware of and ignoring such an issue could potentially cause detrimental harm to a business’ reputation. For instance, if a business remained ignorant to the fact that elements of their supply chain supported Russia they could face a public outcry and a reduction in customers. Conversely, a business that was aware of the situation could opt to assist in aid efforts. An action such as this could not only benefit Ukrainian refugees but could also benefit the company’s public image, leading to an increase in consumers and subsequent profits.</div><div><br></div><div>  
</div><div>Ultimately, your values matter. It is within your power to support causes that are important to you, your employees and your customers through your business decisions. Choosing to get involved may not always be the best course of action for your business, but remaining aware of how the actions of your business can inadvertently affect social and political issues is necessary. When it comes down to it, everyone can make a difference even through small actions. By doing so, you can not only support the causes you care about but also support the welfare of your business.</div><div><br></div><div> 
</div><div><strong>Examples of Causes and Campaigns</strong></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><em>Abortion Rights Movement</em>:
</div><div>The Abortion Rights Movement, or the pro-choice movement, advocates for legal access to induced abortion services including elective abortion. It seeks to represent and support women who wish to terminate their pregnancy at any point. This movement attempts to establish a right for women to make the choice to have an abortion without fear of legal and/or social backlash.
</div><div><br></div><div><em>Black Lives Matter Movement (BLM)</em>:
</div><div>An international social movement, formed in the United States in 2013, dedicated to fighting racism and anti-Black violence, especially in the form of police brutality.
</div><div><br></div><div><em>Climate Activism</em>:
</div><div>A global social movement focused on pressuring governments and industry to take action addressing the causes and impacts of climate change.
</div><div><br></div><div><em>LGBTQ+ Rights Movement</em>:
</div><div>A movement to ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people can live openly without discrimination and enjoy equal rights, personal autonomy, and freedom of expression and association.
</div><div><br></div><div><em>Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill</em>:
</div><div>A bill in the UK to allow police more control over protests, supposedly with the intent of preventing protests from inhibiting everyday activity. 
</div><div><br></div><div><em>Right to Protest</em>:
</div><div>May be a manifestation of the right to freedom of assembly, the right to freedom of association, and the right to freedom of speech.
</div><div><br></div><div><em>Roe v. Wade</em>:
</div><div>A landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States conferred the right to have an abortion. The decision struck down many federal and state abortion laws, and fueled an ongoing abortion debate in the United States about whether, or to what extent, abortion should be legal, who should decide the legality of abortion, and what the role of moral and religious views in the political sphere should be. It was overturned in June 2022. 
</div><div><br></div><div><em>Climate Activism</em>:
</div><div>A global social movement focused on pressuring governments and industry to take action addressing the causes and impacts of climate change.</div><div>
